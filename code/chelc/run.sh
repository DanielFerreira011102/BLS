python main.py --input-text "Diabetes mellitus is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels due to impaired insulin function. Glucose, derived from dietary carbohydrates, serves as the primary energy source for cellular metabolism. Insulin, a peptide hormone secreted by the pancreatic beta cells, facilitates glucose uptake by cells. Dysfunction in insulin production or cellular response to insulin results in hyperglycemia, which is the hallmark of diabetes." --input-type string --output results.csv --text-weight 0.4 --syntax-weight 0.6 --term-weight 0.0 --semantic-weight 0.0 --no-normalize

python main.py --input-text "Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from chronic hyperglycemia due to defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Blood glucose, primarily obtained from dietary intake, is essential for cellular respiration. Insulin, synthesized by the Î²-cells of the pancreatic islets, mediates cellular glucose uptake via GLUT transporters. In diabetes, insufficient insulin production or peripheral insulin resistance disrupts glucose homeostasis, leading to pathological sequelae such as microvascular and macrovascular complications." --input-type string --output results.csv --text-weight 0.4 --syntax-weight 0.6 --term-weight 0.0 --semantic-weight 0.0 --no-normalize
