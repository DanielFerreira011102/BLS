"Diabetes is a condition that happens when there is too much sugar in your blood. The sugar in your blood, called glucose, comes from the food you eat and gives your body energy. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas. It helps move glucose from your blood into your cells, where it's used for energy.",0.25,0.375,0.3125,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.275,0.4,0.6,0.0,0.0,True,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,12,1000
"Diabetes is a health condition that occurs when blood glucose (sugar) levels are too high. Glucose, which comes from the food we eat, is our main source of energy. The hormone insulin, produced by the pancreas, helps transport glucose into the body's cells so it can be used for energy. Without enough insulin, glucose stays in the blood instead of reaching the cells.",0.5,0.375,0.4375,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.475,0.4,0.6,0.0,0.0,True,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,12,1000
"Diabetes mellitus is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels due to impaired insulin function. Glucose, derived from dietary carbohydrates, serves as the primary energy source for cellular metabolism. Insulin, a peptide hormone secreted by the pancreatic beta cells, facilitates glucose uptake by cells. Dysfunction in insulin production or cellular response to insulin results in hyperglycemia, which is the hallmark of diabetes.",0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.4,0.6,0.0,0.0,True,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,12,1000
"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from chronic hyperglycemia due to defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Blood glucose, primarily obtained from dietary intake, is essential for cellular respiration. Insulin, synthesized by the Î²-cells of the pancreatic islets, mediates cellular glucose uptake via GLUT transporters. In diabetes, insufficient insulin production or peripheral insulin resistance disrupts glucose homeostasis, leading to pathological sequelae such as microvascular and macrovascular complications.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.4,0.6,0.0,0.0,True,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,12,1000
