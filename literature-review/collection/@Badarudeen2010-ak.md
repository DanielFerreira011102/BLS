  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Health literacy is the single best predictor of an
               individual's health status. It is important to customize
               health-related education material to the individual patient's
               level of reading skills. Readability of a given text is the
               objective measurement of the reading skills one should possess
               to understand the written material. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: In this
               article, some of the commonly used readability assessment tools
               are discussed and guidelines to improve the comprehension of
               patient education handouts are provided. Where are we now?
               Several healthcare organizations have recommended the
               readability of patient education materials be no higher than
               sixth- to eighth-grade level. However, most of the patient
               education materials currently available on major orthopaedic Web
               sites are written at a reading level that may be too advanced
               for comprehension by a substantial proportion of the population.
               WHERE DO WE NEED TO GO?: There are several readily available and
               validated tools for assessing the readability of written
               materials. While use of audiovisual aids such as video clips,
               line drawings, models, and charts can enhance the comprehension
               of a health-related topic, standard readability tools cannot
               construe such enhancements. HOW DO WE GET THERE?: Given the
               variability in the capacity to comprehend health-related
               materials among individuals seeking orthopaedic care,
               stratifying the contents of patient education materials at
               different levels of complexity will likely improve health
               literacy and enhance patient-centered communication.",
