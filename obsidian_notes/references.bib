    abstract = "As the number of scientific publications is growing at a rapid pace, it is difficult for laypeople to keep track of and understand the latest scientific advances, especially in the biomedical domain. While the summarization of scientific publications has been widely studied, research on summarization targeting laypeople has remained scarce. In this study, considering the lengthy input of biomedical articles, we have developed a lay summarization system through an extract-then-summarize framework with large language models (LLMs) to summarize biomedical articles for laypeople. Using a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model, our approach achieves the highest overall ranking and demonstrates the best relevance performance in the BioLaySumm 2024 shared task.",

We worked on this problem as participating in BioLaySumm 2024. We experimented with various fine-tuning approaches to generate better lay summaries for biomedical research articles. After several experiments, we built a LoRA model with unsupervised fine-tuning based on the abstracts of the given articles, followed by a post-processing unit to take off repeated sentences. Our model was ranked 3rd overall in the BioLaySumm 2024 leaderboard. We analyzed the different approaches we experimented with and suggested several ideas to improve our model further.",

We consider two approaches to address this issue: Hard Truncation, which preserves the most informative initial portion of the article, and Text Chunking, which segments articles into smaller, manageable chunks. Our workflow encompasses data preprocessing, augmentation, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning large language models. We explore the influence of pretrained model selection, inference prompt design, and hyperparameter tuning on summarization performance. Our methods demonstrate effectiveness in generating high-quality, informative lay summaries, achieving the second-best performance in the BioLaySumm shared task at BioNLP 2024.",

To address this urgent issue, we participated in the BioLaySumm task at the 2024 ACL BioNLP workshop, which focuses on automatically simplifying technical biomedical articles for non-technical audiences. We conduct a systematic evaluation of the SOTA large language models (LLMs) in 2024 and found that LLMs can generally achieve better readability scores than smaller models like Bart. Then we iteratively developed techniques of title infusing, K-shot prompting , LLM rewriting and instruction finetuning to further boost readability while balancing factuality and relevance. Notably, our submission achieved the first place in readability at the workshop, and among the top-3 teams with the highest readability scores, we have the best overall rank. Here, we present our experiments and findings on how to effectively adapt LLMs for automatic lay summarization. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhoujieli/biolaysumm.",
